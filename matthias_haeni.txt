My name is Matthias Haeni. I am a systems engineer and data scientist at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, working in the Research Unit "Forest Dynamics". Currently, I am working on projects called SwissForestLabs, TreeNet and ICOS. I have a PhD in Environmental Sciences, with a specialty in processing large dataset such as CO2 flux data from European forests. I use mostly R and Shiny for my daily work but also work with various NoSQL databases, Spark, and Cassandra.
