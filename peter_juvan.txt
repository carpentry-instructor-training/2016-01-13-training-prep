Peter Juvan (M) is a research assistant at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (since 2005), and an assistant professor of Bioinformatics at the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies, University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia (since 2011). In 2000 he graduated from Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana and continued his postgraduate studies at the same institution in tight collaboration with the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. He developed novel artificial intelligence and bioinformatics approaches for functional genomics with particular emphasis on abductive reasoning. He received PhD in Computer Science in 2005 and continued as a postdoctoral fellow at CFGBC where his research focused on bioinformatics approaches for studies of molecular mechanisms of cholesterol homeostasis, drug metabolism and the circadian regulation in mouse and human. Since 2013 he is the Training Coordinator of the Slovenian ELIXIR node. At present, his research work includes DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics, statistical and enrichment analysis approaches of high-throughput data, integrative and predictive mining of biological data, automated inference of biological networks and data visualization.
